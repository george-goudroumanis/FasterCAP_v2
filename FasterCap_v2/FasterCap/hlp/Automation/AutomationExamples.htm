<H1>FasterCap Automation Example Programs</H1>

Altough Automation is a complex topic, using FasterCap via Automation is simple enough. To get you started, we have created some example scripts which can be used to learn how to control FasterCap and as a base to build more complex applications. In spite of their short length, these examples are quite comprehensive and the source code is well commented.

<p>You can find the example files in a sub-directory in FasterCap's installation directory.

<H2>FasterCapClient Sample Program</H2>
This is the most complete example, which shows the use of all FasterCap methods and properties. To compile this example, you must have MS Visual Basic 6.0 (or newer) installed.
<br>For your convenience, we provided also the executable file that you can directly run, provided that you have Visual Basic 6.0 DLL installed.

<H2>fastercap_drive.xls Sample Program</H2>
This is a Visual Basic for Applications example. To run this example, you must have MS Excel 2000 (or newer) installed. With minor modifications, marked with proper comments in the Visual Basic source code embedded in the spreadsheet, you can also run the same example using LibreOffice Calc.
<p>Remark: for the script to work, you must answer 'yes' at the prompt which asks you if you want to enable the macros, when you load the file into Excel or Calc.
<p>Remark: the files sphere0.txt, sphere1.txt, sphere2.txt, sphere3.txt are used by this script and must reside in the same directory of fastercap_drive.xls for the script to work.

<H2>fastercap_drive.vbs Sample Program</H2>
This is a Visual Basic Script example. The best way to launch this script is from a DOS shell, typing "cscript fastercap_drive.vbs", in the directory where fastercap_drive.vbs resides.
You can also double-click on the file name, but in this case all the log messages will appear in separate pop-up message boxes.
<p>Remark: the files sphere0.txt, sphere1.txt, sphere2.txt, sphere3.txt are used by this script and must reside in the same directory of fastercap_drive.vbs for the script to work.
