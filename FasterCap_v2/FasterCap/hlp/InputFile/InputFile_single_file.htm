<H1>FasterCap Input Files</H1>

<H2>Single Input File option</H2>

FasterCap supports also the option to specify all input data in a single file. This avoids the need for a possibly large number of different input files.
<p>The format is as follows:

<p><code>(main input file)
<br>End
<br>File &lt;first_sub-file&gt;
<br>(contents of &lt;first_sub-file&gt;)
<br>End
<br>File &lt;second_sub-file&gt;
<br>(contents of &lt;second_sub-file&gt;)
<br>End
</code>

<p>In this way, all references to external files can be replaced by internal references; for instance, if you write

<br><code>C first_sub-file  1.0  0.0 0.0 0.0
</code>

<br>FasterCap will not try to access the file 'first_sub-file' from the file system, but will take the data from the 'File' section as per the above definition.

<p>FasterCap allows hierarchical definitions, i.e. 'first_sub-file' can contain references to 'second_sub-file'. If the referenced files are not found internally, FasterCap assumes that they reside on the file system, and will look for them accordingly.

<p>The characters following 'E' in 'End' and following 'F' in 'File' are optional. Like the other statements, 'E' and 'F' are case-insensitive, and must be the first character of the line in which they are defined.
<br>Moreover, the 'End' statement in itself is optional, and is included only for input file readibility.

<p>You can find some examples of single input files in the 'Samples' directory, for both 3D and 2D models.
